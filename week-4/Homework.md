# Homework

Over the next few weeks, we'll create an API together.

The API is for a 52 card deck shuffler, and it needs to handle the following:

- Shuffle a new pack of cards
- Store the state of the shuffled deck
- Return a new unique ID for the deck
- Return the sequence if cards in the shuffled deck

We will also create an interface that uses the API.

----

The reason we're doing it in this sequence (API -> UI) is because it's easier to build an inerface when you know the capabilities of an API.

When you build a UI first, and retrofit an API, you continually run into scope-creep and integration hurdles.

## Setup

We will use the following as a working repository:

Requirements:

- Apache
- PHP
- MySQL
